Preliminary Bounded Context Split:

Everything regarding pricing => Pricing
Everything regarding actually operating the service => RideSharing

Trying not to share too many domain-classes between the two.

(People holding on to a car for days/weeks, or taking the car to Spain)

Is it legal to remotely turn off a vehicle like this? That could be dangerous. Who knows?
